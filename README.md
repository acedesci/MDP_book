This folder contains the latest drafts of selected chapters of the forthcoming book "Introduction to Markov Decision Processes" by Martin Puterman and Tim Chan. They are in varying degrees of completeness.  Please share any comments on material or typos with the authors ASAP.

# Book objective 

The intent of the book is to provide a rigorous yet accessible foundation to Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning.   

# Requisite Background

The book is aimed at fourth year undergraduates and graduate students and features many examples and problems.We believe a suitable background to read this book includes linear algebra, probability (especially Markov Chains), linear regression and analysis.  The reader should be comfortable with mathematical notation and a theorem-proof framework.
